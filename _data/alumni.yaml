# This file contains all alumni displayed on https://chandar-lab.github.io/people/
# Once a member becomes inactive, their details should be moved from people.yaml to alumni.yaml.
# Note that the format of alumni.yaml is slightly different from people.yaml.

# The title field must be either: pi, postdoc, phd, or intern
# The profile_page must be true or false. Set to false if the person already have an entry
#   in either the alumni.yaml or people.yaml file. This is to prevent generating a profile
#   page multiple times for the same person, as this will generate a warning.
# The website field is optional.
# The next field must contain both english (en) and french (fr) translations.
# People will be sorted by period.end
