I am an assistant professor at the [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/), a core academic member of the [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), [CIFAR AI Chair](https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/), and co-director of the [Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)](https://montrealrobotics.ca/). 
    I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. 
    His previous and current research has focused on solving sequential decision-making problems for real-world autonomous learning systems (robots). 
    The specific of his research has covered the areas of reinforcement-, continual-, meta-, hierarchical learning, and human-robot collaboration. 
    In his work, Dr. Berseth has published at top venues across the disciplines of robotics, machine learning, and computer animation. 
    Currently, he is teaching a course on robot learning at Université de Montréal and Mila that covers the most recent research on machine learning techniques for creating generalist robots.
