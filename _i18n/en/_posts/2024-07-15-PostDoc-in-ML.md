## About Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Montreal is a city of about 2 million (Greater Montreal: 4 million) located in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is famous for its art and food scenes and its summer festivals, including the Montreal Jazz Festival. There are few days from late May to late September when there isn’t some festival going on. Although the winters can get cold, they enable a wide range of winter activities, from cross-country skiing on Mont-Royal Park to feasting on maple syrup-laden foods in late March.
