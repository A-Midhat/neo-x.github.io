I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/">Université de Montréal</a>, a core academic member of the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a>, <a href="https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/">Canada CIFAR AI chair</a>, and co-director of the <a href="https://montrealrobotics.ca/">Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)</a>. 
    I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. 
    My previous and current research is focused on solving sequential decision-making problems for real-world autonomous learning systems (robots). 
    The specific of my research has covered the areas of reinforcement-, continual-, meta-, hierarchical learning, and human-robot collaboration. 
    In my work, I have published at top venues across robotics, machine learning, and computer animation disciplines. 
    Currently, I am teaching a course on robot learning at Université de Montréal and Mila that covers the most recent research on machine learning techniques for creating generalist robots.
