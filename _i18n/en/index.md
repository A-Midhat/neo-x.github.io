# About the Lab:


Chandar Research Lab (CRL) is a machine learning research group in the Department of Computer and Software Engineering at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/). The long-term mission of our group is to develop interactive learning algorithms that continuously learn from experiences. Currently, the lab focuses on several areas in machine learning including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Lifelong Learning, and Natural Language Processing. 

CRL is also affiliated with [Mila, the Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/).
