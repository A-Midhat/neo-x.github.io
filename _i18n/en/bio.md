Glen Berseth is an assistant professor at the <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/">Université de Montréal</a>, a core academic member of <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a>, <a href="https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/">Canada CIFAR AI chair</a>, member l'<a href="https://institut-courtois.umontreal.ca/">Institute Courtios</a>, and co-director of the <a href="https://montrealrobotics.ca/">Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)</a>.  He was a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> working in the <a href="http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Robotic AI & Learning (RAIL)</a> lab with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. Glen completed his <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">NSERC</a>-supported Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> in 2019, where he worked with <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/">Michiel van de Panne</a>. His previous and current research has focused on solving sequential decision-making problems (planning) for real-world autonomous learning systems (robots). The specific of his research has covered the areas of human-robot collaboration, reinforcement, continual-, meta-, multi-agent, and hierarchical learning. Dr. Berseth has published across the top venues in robotics, machine learning, and computer animation in his work. He also teaches a course on robot learning at Université de Montréal and Mila, covering the most recent research on machine learning techniques for creating generalist robots.
