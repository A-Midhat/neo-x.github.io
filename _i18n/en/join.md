The Lab performs research across machine learning, planning and robotics. See our [publications]({% link publications.html %}) for more details on what the current [members]({% link people.html %}) are studying. 

Here is a mutable list of topics of interest for the lab. Students should be interested in these topics when applying and reference their related topics of interest when applying.

- **Sequential decision making and reinforcement learning**: multi-agent RL, generalization in RL, hierarchical RL, sample efficient RL, RL for discovery, language-based RL agents, goal conditioned RL, offline RL.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: unsupervised RL, intrinsic rewards, representation learning for deepRL, safe RL.
- **Robotics**: Legged robotics, planning from vision, autonomous learning, large models for robotics, control theory, Sim2Real.
- **Computer Vision**: Vision models for robotics, vision-language models, invariant representations.

Please apply through one of these forms. It is unlikely I will respond to individual emails.
