The Lab performs research across machine learning, planning and robotics. See our [publications]({% link publications.html %}) for more details on what the current [members]({% link people.html %}) are studying. 

Here is a mutable list of topics of interest for the lab. Students should be interested in these topics when applying and reference their related topics of interest when applying.

- **Sequential decision making and reinforcement learning**: multi-agent RL, generalization in RL, hierarchical RL, sample efficient RL, RL for scientific discovery, language-based RL agents, goal-conditioned RL, offline RL.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: unsupervised RL, intrinsic rewards, representation learning for deepRL, safe RL.
- **Robotics**: Legged robotics, planning from vision, autonomous learning, large models for robotics, control theory, Sim2Real.
- **Computer Vision**: Vision models for robotics, vision-language models, invariant representations.

Please apply through one of these forms. It is unlikely I will respond to individual emails.


#### Undergraduates interested and/or IFT3150/IFT4150 projects

Please apply through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1moEgwMl7hRk5CBmjX1W1HWX-zD0PW8LPVcdzZC7bHG8/edit?chromeless=1). If you are an undergraduate student, I strongly suggest you consider applying to the [Undergraduate Student Research Award](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) program.
 
#### MSc, PhD, interns, or visiting research MSc/PhD
